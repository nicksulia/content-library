## Installing the system


First, you should install `NodeJS with npm` and  `MongoDB` on your virtual machine.
You can do this by going on their official site.

**Note** All installation scripts work on `Windows` only.

After `MongoDB` installation, you should add path to it's `bin` folder in `PATH` variable.

Then open `cmd` or any other console emulator and run 

 ```bash
mongod --dbpath $path_to_db --port $dbport
 ```
Where `$path_to_db` is path to folder where you want to init your DB and `$dbport` 
free connection port.
 
 Example:
 ```bash
mongod --dbpath C:\data\db1 --port 27001
 ```

After running `mongod` in console go into root folder of the project and change `config`
in `serverConfig.js` on yours. **Note** that you need to change `portDB` and `databaseUrl`
 when you changing default db port.
 
 First install all modules running: 
 ```bash
npm install
 ``` 
 
 Then run:
 ```bash
npm run generate-data
 ```
**Note** Some console emulators and consoles don't respond with messages,
so you better need to go and check it manually on `mongo --port $dbport`.

*Issues* Sometimes you need to create DB first and then generate and import data.
 
 If data wasn't imported, you can run command from `import.bat` adding you custom 
 parameters instead of `%{1,2,3,4}`

- `/api/findData` - secured API call for getting data. Returns array of data
- `/api/check` - check API. Used for checking token expiration

### Scripts
To start project in development mode with auto re-build, in root folder run: 
 ```bash
npm run watch
 ```
 To build project for production, run: 
 ```bash
npm run build
 ```
  To start server, run: 
  ```bash

 ## Possible issues
 
 - Sometimes mongod instance freeze. You need to switch on it's console and run signal *ex. pressing Enter*
 - if Data have already been imported, you can't overwrite it. 
 Add in import.bat flag `--upsert` if you want to (Not recommended)
